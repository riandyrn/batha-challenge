# Batha Challenge #1 - Newsletter Email Template

In this challenge you will be asked to create new design for Batha Newsletter Email & implement it using HTML & CSS.

The current design is pretty much sucks. Here you could see it by yourself:

- [Desktop View](desktop.jpeg)
- [Mobile View](mobile.jpeg)

So in this challenge you need to revamp this existing design.

Notice that you need to create **email template that look good for both mobile & desktop**. Because the majority of our users are coming from mobile & desktop.

**The deliverables for this challenge are:**

1. High resolution PNG files for the design itself
2. HTML & CSS code for the email template

**Additional Notes:**

The HTML & CSS code for email is slightly different than normal HTML & CSS code. In email, the code must be simple & concise so most likely you cannot use code for ui framework (e.g bootstrap, bulma, etc) in your template.

To test whether your HTML template could work for email or not you need to send actual email to yourself. In order to do that you will need an email server.

The credentials to access the email server will be sent to your registered email along with the credentials to access upload server just in case you need to upload some assets for your template.

Here are some good examples for the email template just in case you need them for reference:

- StackOverflow: [Desktop View](so-desktop.jpeg) & [Mobile View](so-mobile.jpeg)
- Linkedin: [Desktop View](ln-desktop.jpeg) & [Mobile View](ln-mobile.jpeg)

Have fun in the challenge! üòÅ
